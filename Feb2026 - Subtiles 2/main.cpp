 * Trying out JS-puzzles for the first time and I wanted to verify my answers!

 * 2. Working out the space of each "K-omino" on the grid itself, and finally
 * 3. Finding the min/max row/column sum and getting your final answer!
 * I know it could be more efficient, but this is just a fun project I'm doing
